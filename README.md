## What is it?
Overview
- Recommendations is an experimental project to allow users to search and retrieve the content of individual NICE recommendations, independently of their parent guidance. 
- The project separates NICE recommendations and ingests them as separate entities, so that they can also be searched and retriecved separately.
- The project is potentially of interest to anyone who wants to be able to search NICE content at a granular level to find recommendations on similar subjects from different guidance products.
